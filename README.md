This repository constinas the domain and problems used in:
"Task Allocation Strategy for Heterogeneous Robot Teams in Offshore Missions"

1. First folder (constrained_domain) contains the domain and problems that consider 
   the predicate "robot_can_cat" to implement the plan which were generated using the 
   Multi-Role Goal Assignment strategy presented in the paper.

2. Second folder (non-constrained_domain) constains a version of the domain and problems
   in folder one without using the predicates generate by  the MRGA strategy.
